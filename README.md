# Experimental-Diffraction-Fourier-Transform
The project consists in a numerical analysis of a Gaussian beam propagation through various diffraction slits and lenses. 
An image of each set-up is added, depicting different configurations.
My main contribution consisted in modifying the original code provided by the professor, in order to match with the desired caracteristics of the beam, geometry of the slit, or lens in question.
The report includes some analytic procedures, the resulting images, and the specific code for each.
